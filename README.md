Bootstrap Elements
============================
Bootstrap Elements gives you the ability to add modal and toggles to your courses, helping to improve the layout of courses. It is in essence an improved "label" resource type with an opton allowing you to set content to display as a:

* Modal box (popup box)
* Toggle (expandable / drop-down content
* Enhanced Label (with title, really designed so you can turn off Bootstrap features and have content display statically)

This will help teachers add more dynamic, interactive content within courses whilst consuming less space on the page. 

**Please note**: This plugin will only work with themes that are based on Bootstrap and have support for for the Bootstrap elements referenced by this plugin. 

Themes known to work with this plugin are:
* BCU Theme
* Essential Theme
* Shoehorn Theme

We will expand this list to include other themes as we confirm their compatibility.

**Future Plans**:

* Auto detect theme compatability and fall back on non supported themes (so multiple themes in the same site can be supported)
* Add Fontawesome options to easily add icons
* Add color options
* Add additional icon to Toggle to make it clear it is clickable
* Look at other elements such as callouts and possibly Tabs / Accordion

If you have any other suggestions for improvement please let us know!
